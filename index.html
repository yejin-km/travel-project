            <h2>London, capital of England</h2>
            <p>
              London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the
              oldest of the world's great cities—its history spanning nearly two
              millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain's
              largest metropolis, it is also the country's economic,
              transportation, and cultural centre.
            </p>
            <p>
              London is situated in southeastern England, lying astride the
              River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on
              the North Sea. In satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen
              to sit compactly in a Green Belt of open land, with its principal
              ring highway (the M25 motorway) threaded around it at a radius of
              about 20 miles (30 km) from the city centre.
