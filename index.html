            <h2>London, capital of England</h2>
            <p>
              London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the
              oldest of the world's great cities—its history spanning nearly two
              millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain's
              largest metropolis, it is also the country's economic,
              transportation, and cultural centre.
            </p>
            <p>
              London is situated in southeastern England, lying astride the
              River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on
              the North Sea. In satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen
              to sit compactly in a Green Belt of open land, with its principal
              ring highway (the M25 motorway) threaded around it at a radius of
              about 20 miles (30 km) from the city centre.

                <h4>Borough Market</h4>
                <p>
                  This market is one of London's oldest and largest food
                  markets, with over 100 delicatessens, butchers, fishmongers,
                  and cheesemakers selling fresh produce, meats, artisanal
                  delicacies, and more. It's where locals come to do their
                  grocery runs, and where travelers can come to try some of the
                  best British food in a historic setting. Join a food and
                  market tour of London to make sure you don't miss any of the
                  best stalls. It gets busy on weekend afternoons, and some
                  traders aren't open on all days—typically on limited market
                  days early in the week—so be sure to plan ahead.

                <p>
                  Located along the Thames River, this iconic observation wheel
                  offers unobstructed views from its glass pods. During the
                  30-minute ride, you'll be able to see London's well-known
                  buildings like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and The Shard. On a
                  clear day, you can see up to 25 miles from the top—where
                  Windsor Castle is. Sunset views here are otherworldly, but
                  nightfall views of the twinkling lights are great too. London
                  Eye can be reached easily by taking the Tube to Waterloo
                  station. You might want to buy fast-track passes online in
                  advance to skip the queues.
